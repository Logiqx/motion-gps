It comes with your alpha, WiFi connection to your own networks*, a constant LED blinker, custom LED blinking of various speeds**, a revamped web server, a panic restart on 12+ button presses and an easier way to access the webserver

*: connect to the WiFi as usual by pressing the button twice, go to the webserver settings, make sure to refresh the page, enter your WiFi login/password, press the button twice to exit WiFi mode.

â€‹     From now on, you can press the button three times to enter the new WiFi mode. It will blink red/green while searching for your networks, then blink red/green while connecting to it, then stay green forever if connected. Or show red for a few seconds and stop if it couldn't connect. The device will still be active. Your login/password might be wrong or your own WiFi router might be too far.

 **: for example, it will blink your "over 10s #1 run" on four button presses. To be configured in the settings.

Warning: it will forget your current settings.
